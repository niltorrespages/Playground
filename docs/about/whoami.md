# WhoAmI

## Bio
Hi, I'm Nil Torres a professional in the CyberSecurity space. Graduated a few years ago in a degree on 
Telecommunications and Masters in CyberSecurity management. Right now I have my focus on Cloud Security but in the past 
I have done a few pentests, mostly regarding mobile applications.

I started learning and tinkering in this world thanks to being able to tinker with Telecogresca servers and applications. 
Thanks again to all IT members who let me grow there.


I will probably focus this docs to my hobby side, so I don't thing you will find anything professional here. 


## Projects

With my recently bought ChromeBox 4 I have a few cool projects in mind so hopefully I will document them here soon.

Just as a quick list for myself, and nothing I promise working on soon, this is my project list:

- Asus ChromeBox 4  Deffy configuration and installation of Ubuntu serve
- Migrating Telegram bot to server and imporving functionality 
- Smou App wrapper to view availability, make reservations and pick up bikes directly from Telegram Bot, bypassing 
official app (hey, half of the time it doesn't work!)
- HomeAssistant implementation and iot tinkering 
- NAS integration
- DNS local server (maybe pihole)
- VPN to home network
- Update this site! (I'm going to forget about it)

And that should be everything! I have enough projects to get me entertained for a few weeks.

If you have any suggestions, or just want to say hi you can find me on my Github page or Linkedin. Always happy to meet new people!
