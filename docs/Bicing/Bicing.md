# Intro

Bicing is the public bike sharing service in Barcelona and I like to use it quite a lot to move around the city, 
but most of the time using the app is a pain in the ass. 
I've been tinkering a little with the api to extract information regarding the status of the service and to check near 
stations for availability.
