# Mobile Pentest

Interested in how to perform a Mobile Pentest? I will not show how to but guide you to the appropriate documentation. 
Actually is quite easy, just follow OWASP work:

[https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/releases](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/releases)

Here you can find 2 main documents:

- The full OWASP mobile pentest methodology, a book of more than 700 pages with all the detail you require.
- OWASP mobile checklist, a companion spreadsheet to make sure you perform every check possible in the procedure

As the first document is quite dense, I would recommend to check every test in the [OWASP mobile pentest gitbook](https://mobile-security.gitbook.io/mobile-security-testing-guide/),
also a very useful resource.
