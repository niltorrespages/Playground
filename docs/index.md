# Nil's playground

Hi, I'm Nil Torres, nice seeing you here! In this site you can find some of my home projects that I'm working on. Don't 
mind the typos or inconsistencies as I have it just for fun, but please, let me know if you have any suggestions. 

Inspired by Jose Ca√±adillas and his docs [site](https://docs.canadillas.org/), go take a look, they have cool stuff

# This Site 

This Site is made with MkDocs and the theme [Material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material). Just type things 
in Markdown and everything becomes pretty!
